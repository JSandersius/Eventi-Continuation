## What, Why, and How

**What**

We created an app that allows you to log into Spotify, takes your followed artists and links you to ticket master in order to see events near you. It also gives you an option to get a link to buy tickets. You’re also able to search for an artist…the app finds events within 100 mile radius of your current location

**Why**

Created app to allow users to make searching easier when it comes to the artists they listen to. Instead of going to multiple websites this links you automatically from your music to the upcoming event.

**How**

We used a variety of technologies to build our website. We used Bootstrap for styling, jQuery and JS for client side code, the Spotify API and the TicketMaster API to connect everything together.
